# programming_class Repository

This place is just for some raw documents so I can use into my Google Colab Python project Im doing for my Python Code classes in university

I am doing an analysis of the 4 most important big tech stock prices and their graphs

Feel free to check my documents and also my final project in the link below:

Although the project is written in portuguese, all lines of code are obviously written in py, so for that reason if you have any comment, suggestion or recomendation feel free to text my email there

Happy coding for us all!
